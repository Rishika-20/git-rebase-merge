# git-rebase-merge - demo

## In this repository, we have covered the git-rebase and merge part.

#### What is rebase in git?

##### The alternative to git merge is the git rebase option. In this, we rebase the entire feature branch to merge it with the main branch.The git rebase command is used to move the feature branch to the tip of the master branch. The git rebase command is an alternative to the git merge command which is also used to merge or combine two branches. The git rebase command makes the commits be merged linearly.
##### We should not use the git rebase command on public branches.

#### What is merge in git?

##### Git merge is used to merge multiple commits of various branches into a single branch. We perform branching for parallel development of new feature(s) and bug fixing. Once the bug is fixed or the new feature is added, we can merge these branches into a single branch. The git merge command can also be considered as an alternative to the git rebase command which is also used to merge branches.
##### We can use the git merge command on both private and public branches.
